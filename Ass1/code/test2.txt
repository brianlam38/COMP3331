I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an oldbenevolent man with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however,with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors,he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.About half a dozenmen came forward; and, one being selected by the magistrate, hedeposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his son andbrother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o'clock, they observeda strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in forport. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; theydid not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at acreek about two miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part ofthe fishing tackle, and his companions followed him at somedistance. As he was proceeding along the sands, he struck his footagainst something and fell at his length on the ground. His companionscame up to assist him, and by the light of their lantern they foundthat he had fallen on the body of a man, who was to all appearancedead. Their first supposition was that it was the corpse of someperson who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves, buton examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even thatthe body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottageof an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restoreit to life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five andtwenty years of age. He had apparently been strangled, for there wasno sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on hisneck. The first part of this deposition did not in the least interestme, but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered themurder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbstrembled, and a mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on achair for support.
